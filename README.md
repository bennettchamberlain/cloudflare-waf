# Bot Shield - Platform-Specific Bot Management

Bot Shield is a comprehensive bot management solution designed specifically for modern hosting platforms like Webflow, Netlify, Vercel, and Shopify.

- **Shopify stores**: Constant product scraping and inventory monitoring

## ✨ The Solution

Bot Shield provides:
- **Platform-specific protection** optimized for each hosting provider
- **Real-time bot detection** using advanced scoring algorithms
- **Comprehensive savings reports** showing exact ROI
- **One-click deployment** via Cloudflare Workers
- **Live monitoring** of blocked traffic and cost savings
